Maemo-GPT is a lightweight ChatGPT client written in C with a GTK2 UI.
The purpose of this small application is to provide a usable ChatGPT client without Javascript and with very low HW specs.
It should be possible to use this application with DeepSeek or Mistral AI in a near future.

Maemo-GPT is still a WIP.

### Working functionalities ###
## OpenAI API key is needed ##

-Basic chat (with history)

-Model selection

-Assistant (config file needs assistant and thread ID's from your OpenAI account)

-Vision (it needs a downloaded image from the web, like the website does)

-Image generation (it uses Links2 gui to show and save images)

-Text to Speech (from new text or current chat)

-List files from your account

-Save, load and reset chat history


### WIP ###

-Uploading file (file selection works but upload not)

-Assistant and thread creation from the app (works from command line, needs to be implemented)

-Speech to text (works locally but needs to be implemented)

-Temperature and various parameters


### Configuration ###

The config file template is hardcoded and will appear in $HOME/.maemo-gpt folder after the first launch and after you click on 'Send' button.
For all functionalities (excepting assistant), you just need to provide your API key.
However Assistant needs thread and assistant ID's.


### Miscellaneous ###

Maemo-GPT uses libcurl to be able to run on low power devices: when you send a request, you can't interact with the UI until you receive the answer (it takes usually between 1 and 7 seconds on N900).
Maemo-GPT keeps your conversation history (even when the app is closed) until you reset it.


### For N900 users ###

ChatGPT seems 'fascinated' when you tell 'it' you're using a N900 to chat.
